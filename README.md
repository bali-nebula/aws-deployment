### Getting Started
Prior to cloning this project, several local tools need to be installed.

#### Installing HomeBrew
We use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the other things we need, so here
is how to install it:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew update
brew doctor
```

#### Installing Python3
The scripts that are used in this repository depend on [python3](https://www.python.org/).
Here is how to install it:
```
brew install python
python --version
```

#### Installing AWS CLI
The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/index.html#cli-aws)
is used by some of the bash scripts in this repository.
Here is how to install it:
```
brew install awscli
aws --version
```

#### Installing Boto3
Some of the [AWS S3 CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html)
commands don't work well, so instead we use the
[python3 boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
library. Here is how to install it:
```
pip install boto3
```
